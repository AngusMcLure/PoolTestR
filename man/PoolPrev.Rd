\title{Estimation of prevalence based on presence/absence tests on pooled samples}
\usage{
PoolPrev(data, TestResult, PoolSize, ..., alpha = 0.05, verbose = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A \code{data.frame} with one row for each pooled sampled and columns for
the size of the pool (i.e. the number of specimens / isolates / insects
pooled to make that particular pool), the result of the test of the pool.
It may also contain additional columns with additional information (e.g.
location where pool was taken) which can optionally be used for splitting
the data into smaller groups and calculting prevalence by group (e.g.
calculating prevalence for each location)}

\item{TestResult}{The name of column with the result of each test on each pooled sample.
The result must be stored with 1 indicating a positive test result and
0 indicating a negative test result.}

\item{PoolSize}{The name of the column with number of specimens/isolates/insects in each pool}

\item{...}{Optional name(s) of columns with variables to group the data by.
If ommitted the complete dataset is used to estimate a single prevalence.
If included prevalence is estimated spearately for each group defined by these columns}

\item{alpha}{The confidence level to be used for the confidence and credible intervals. Defaults to 0.5\% (i.e. 95\% intervals)}

\item{verbose}{Logical indicating whether to print progress to screen. Defaults to false (no printing to screen)}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with columns:
\itemize{
 \item{\code{MLE} (the Maximum Likleihood Estimate of prevelance)}
 \item{\code{LR-CI Lower} and \code{LR-CI Upper} (Lower and Upper Confidence intervals using the Likelihood Ratio method)}
 \item{\code{Bayesian Posterior Expectation}}
 \item{\code{Bayesian CI Lower} and \code{Bayesian CI Upper}}
 \item{\code{Number of Pools}}
 \item{\code{Number Positive}}
}
If grouping variables are provided in \code{...} there will be an additional column for each grouping variable.
When there are no grouping variables (supplied in \code{...}) then the dataframe has only one row with the prevalence estimates for the whole dataset.
When grouping variables are supplied, then there is a seperate row for each group.

\examples{
#Build a fake dataset with 1000 pools taken from 4 different locations and 3 different times
Data <- data.frame(Place = sample(c("A","B","C","D"),1000, replace = TRUE),
                   Date = sample(as.Date(c("2000/1/1","2001/1/1","2002/1/1")),1000, replace = TRUE),
                   NumInPool = sample(1:10,1000, replace = TRUE),
                   Result = sample(0:1,1000,replace = TRUE)
                   )
#Prevalence across the whole (fake) dataset
PoolPrev(Data, Result,NumInPool)
#Prevalence at each location
PoolPrev(Data, Result,NumInPool,Place)
#Prevalence for each time period
PoolPrev(Data, Result,NumInPool,Date)
#Prevalence for each combination of location and time period
PoolPrev(Data, Result,NumInPool,Place,Date)
