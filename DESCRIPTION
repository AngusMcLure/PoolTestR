Description: Tools for working with pooled samples inspired by PoolScreen.
    The package is currently in early stages.
    Currently the package only has core functionally, however more features are planned or in the works:
    e.g. adjustments for imperfect test specificity/sensitivity;
    functions for helping with optimal experimental design;
    functions for inferring whether a disease has been locally eliminated from a series of pooled tests over time.
