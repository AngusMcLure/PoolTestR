This is our first official release! Please see the github site (https://github.com/AngusMcLure/PoolTestR#pooltestr) for a basic crash course on using the package. An upcoming (open access) journal article will go into further detail. A preprint can be accessed at https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05405. I'll post a link to the article when published.
