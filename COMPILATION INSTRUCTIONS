NOTES FOR BUILDING PACKAGE ON ANGUS' WINDOWS MACHINE

Compilation will not work out of the box on Angus' machine. During compilation
it runs into issues files being too big.

Changes to make it work:

Add the following to configure.win

# Add configuration needed for big object files
echo "PKG_CXXFLAGS += -Wa,-mbig-obj" >> ./src/Makevars.win

This will allow for compilation, however the .dll produced will be enormous
(preventing hosting on github) if compiled with some commands.
I have not figured out which commands are the issue, but this inlcudes:
* the default build configuration in load_all(recompile = TRUE)
* roxygenise()

Note that the above work fine if not recompiling Cpp/stan code.

To avoid the large .dll problem, make sure all building of packages that
involves recompiling stan/Cpp code happens with the 'Install' or
'Clean and Install' button in RStudio
