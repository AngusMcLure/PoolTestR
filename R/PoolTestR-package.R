#' The 'PoolTestR' package.
#'
#' @description This is a package for working with presence/absence tests on pooled
#'              or grouped samples. The primary application is for estimating prevalence of
#'              a marker in a population based on the results of tests on pooled specimens.
#'              This sampling method is often employed in surveillance of rare conditions in
#'              humans or animals (e.g. livestock or xenomonitoring). The package was initially
#'              conceived as an R-based alternative to the xenomonitoring software,
#'              PoolScreen. However, it goes further, allowing for estimates of prevalence to
#'              adjusted for hierarchy in sampling frames, and perform flexible (mixed effect)
#'              regression analyses. The package is currently in early stages, however more
#'              features are planned or in the works: e.g. adjustments for imperfect test
#'              specificity/sensitivity, functions for helping with optimal experimental
#'              design, and functions for spatial modelling.
